        <p class="over">Over the past 100 years, alot of areas in life have been revolutionized but <br> education is not one of them. Historically,
             higher education has avoided <br> competitive disruption. One reason for this past immunity is the power <br> of prestige in the higher education marketplace, 
             where the quality of the <br> product is hard to measure. At Ubunifu Our focus is to graduate all <br> students innovation
             ready, ready to solve problems creatively.</p>

            <p>Ubunifu College is not a coding school, its a startup school.
                 We measure success by students ability to build a 
                product and launch to market within a given timeline.</p>
